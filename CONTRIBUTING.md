# Contributing to the Windows Community Toolkit Documentation

Please visit the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/blob/main/Contributing.md) for the Windows Community Toolkit.

Documentation is **required** when adding, removing, or updating a control or an API in the Windows Community Toolkit. To update the documentation, you must submit a separate Pull Request in this repository as well (use the *master* branch for typos/improvements and *dev* for new features).

**Both Pull Requests (code and docs) must be approved by the core team before either one is merged.**

Make sure to update both Pull Requests with a link to each other.

If adding a new documentation page:

* Copy the [documentation template](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/blob/master/docs/.template.md) and follow the same format.
* Update the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/blob/master/docs/toc.md) to point to the new page
