When opening a PR, start by forking this repository. Then, based on the type of change you're making you'll need to create a new branch from either the `main` or `dev` branches:

:exclamation: If you have a typo or existing document improvement to an already shipped feature, please base your change off the [`main` branch](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/tree/main). This will allow us to get the change to the published documentation between releases.

:new::books: For documentation regarding any new features, please base your fork off the last updated dev branch. For example: 'dev/7.1.0'.

We will merge updates from the current main branch to the latest dev branch to keep it in-sync with any updated changes. We will periodically sync the main branch automatically with the live branch to pick up any changes made over time. When we make a new release, we will integrate the dev branch into the main branch in order to publish documentation for new features.
