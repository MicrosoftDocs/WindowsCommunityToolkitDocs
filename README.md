When opening a PR, start by forking this repository. Then, based on the type of change you're making you'll need to create a new branch from either the `master` or `dev` branches:

:exclamation: If you have a typo or existing document improvement to an already shipped feature, please base your change off of the [Master branch](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/tree/master). This will allow us to get the change to the published documentation between releases.

:new::books: For documentation regarding any new features, please base your fork off the last updated dev branch. For example: 'dev/7.1.0'.

We will merge updates from the current dev branch to 'master' to keep master in-sync with the live branch. When we make a new release, we will push the live branch in order to publish documentation for new features.
