The [PeoplePicker Control](/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.uwp.ui.controls.graph.peoplepicker) is a simple control that allows for selection of one or more users from an organizational AD, see more details [here](/graph/people-example), it relies on the [MicrosoftGraphService](../../services/MicrosoftGraph.md) for authentication.

## Syntax

```xaml
<Page ...
    xmlns:controls="using:Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.UI.Controls.Graph"/>

<controls:PeoplePicker x:Name="PeoplePicker1"
    AllowMultiple="True" />
```

## Properties

|           Property           |             Type             |                                    Description                                    |

|           GroupId            |            String            | Search people in this group if specified, otherwise, search the organizational AD |
|        AllowMultiple         |           Boolean            |                      Whether multiple people can be selected                      |
|      SearchResultLimit       |             Int              |                     Max person returned in the search results                     |

|          Selections          | ObservableCollection\<Person> |                             The selected person list                              |

## Sample Code

First of all, initialize the [MicrosoftGraphService](../../services/MicrosoftGraph.md) with your [Azure AD v2.0 app](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-app-registration), this should be done globally with the combined and unique [delegate permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-scopes) required by all Graph controls and services used in your app.

```csharp
MicrosoftGraphService.Instance.AuthenticationModel = MicrosoftGraphEnums.AuthenticationModel.V2;

MicrosoftGraphService.Instance.Initialize(
    "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    MicrosoftGraphEnums.ServicesToInitialize.UserProfile,
    PeoplePicker.RequiredDelegatedPermissions
);
```

The sign in will be processed by the [AadLogin](AadLogin.md) control, however, you could do sign in with the following alternatively.

```csharp
await MicrosoftGraphService.Instance.LoginAsync();
```
