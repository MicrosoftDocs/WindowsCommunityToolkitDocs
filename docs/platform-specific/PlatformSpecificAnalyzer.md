# Platform Specific Analyzer

> [!WARNING]
> This docs page is outdated and the Platform Specific Analyzers have been removed. Improvements are continually being made to the Visual Studio development experience, so please ensure you are on the latest version.

When writing [version](/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/version-adaptive-code) or platform adaptive code, the developers should ensure that code checks for presence of API before calling it.
The platform specific analyzer is a Roslyn Analyzer that can parse through code and suggest fixes where appropriate.
