# RemoteDevicePicker

The [RemoteDevicePicker](/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.uwp.ui.controls.remotedevicepicker) gives you a list of Remote Systems. All the systems must be signed in with the same Microsoft Account (MSA)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you enable the [RemoteSystem capability](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#general-use-capabilities) in your app's `package.appxmanifest` to access remote system information.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Try it in the sample app](uwpct://Controls?sample=RemoteDevicePicker)

## Syntax

```csharp
RemoteDevicePicker remoteDevicePicker = new RemoteDevicePicker()
{
    Title = "Pick Remote Device",
    SelectionMode = RemoteDevicesSelectionMode.Multiple
};
var result = await remoteDevicePicker.PickDeviceAsync();
await new MessageDialog($"You picked {result.Count.ToString()} Device(s)" + Environment.NewLine + string.Join(",", result.Select(x => x.DisplayName.ToString()).ToList())).ShowAsync();
```

You can also use default filter types for initializing. Like Below.

```csharp
RemoteDevicePicker remoteDevicePicker = new RemoteDevicePicker(RemoteSystemDiscoveryType.Proximal, RemoteSystemAuthorizationKind.Anonymous, RemoteSystemStatusType.Any)
{
    Title = "Pick Remote Device",
    SelectionMode = RemoteDevicesSelectionMode.Multiple
};

var remoteSystems = await remoteDevicePicker.PickDeviceAsync();
await new MessageDialog($"You picked {remoteSystems.Count().ToString()} Device(s)" + Environment.NewLine + string.Join(",", remoteSystems.Select(x => x.DisplayName.ToString()).ToList())).ShowAsync();
```
