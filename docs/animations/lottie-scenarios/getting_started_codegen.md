# Using Codegen

Consuming [Bodymovin](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/) JSON files is the standard way of displaying Lottie animations on Web, Android, and iOS. However, this approach comes with the overhead of having to parse and translate JSON in your applicationâ€™s process. You can get significant performance benefits by having Lottie-Windows generate the animation code as a C# or C++ class ahead of time, which may be used instead of the [LottieVisualSource](/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.uwp.ui.lottie.lottievisualsource). Both approaches, JSON and Codegen, have the same visual outcome but [different workflows and benefits](./json_codegen.md).

## Generating a C# or C++ class from JSON

To generate a C# or C++ file from JSON use the [LottieGen](https://aka.ms/lottiegen) command-line tool.

1. In your command-line interface, install the LottieGen tool from nuget:

    ```
    dotnet tool install -g LottieGen
    ```

2. Generate classes in your desired language as follows:

    ```
    LottieGen -InputFile LottieLogo1.json -Language cs
    ```

For additional information about additional options including optimizations, use `LottieGen -Help`.

## Using the Codegen File

1. Add the generated file, _LottieLogo1.cs_, to your project by following steps similar to those outlined previously. Ensure that the [Build Action](/visualstudio/ide/build-actions) for all codegen C# or C++ files is set to **Compile**.

2. By default, all codegen classes are generated in the _AnimatedVisuals_ namespace. Modify your Page.xaml to include the namespace:

    ```xaml
    xmlns:animatedvisuals="using:AnimatedVisuals"
    ```

3. Install the [Microsoft.UI.Xaml nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml/) which contains the [AnimatedVisualPlayer](/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.animatedvisualplayer) element. Modify your Page.xaml to include the namespace:

    ```xaml
    xmlns:controls="using:Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls"
    ```

4. Instantiate the [AnimatedVisualPlayer](/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.animatedvisualplayer) element and configure its [Source](/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.animatedvisualplayer.source) as follows:

    ```xaml
        <Border Style="{StaticResource LottiePlayer}">
            <!--AnimatedVisualPlayer with AutoPlay-->
            <controls:AnimatedVisualPlayer x:Name="LottiePlayer">
                <!--Codegen class AnimatedVisuals/LottieLogo1.cs-->
                <animatedvisuals:LottieLogo1/>
            </controls:AnimatedVisualPlayer>
        </Border>
    ```

This should result in a looping Lottie animation that is visually identical to our earlier approach of using a JSON file:
