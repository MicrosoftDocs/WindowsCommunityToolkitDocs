# DispatcherHelper

> [!WARNING]
> This type has been deprecated and it will be removed from the Windows Community Toolkit, please refer to the [`DispatcherQueueExtensions`](..\extensions\DispatcherQueueExtensions.md) type.

The DispatcherHelper class enables easy interaction with [CoreDispatcher](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcher), mainly in the case of executing a block of code on the UI thread from a non-UI thread.

_What is included in the helper?_

- Extension method with overloads for [CoreDispatcher](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcher) class.

- Extension method with overloads for [CoreApplicationView](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplicationView) (for multi window applications).

- Static helper methods for executing a specific function on the UI thread of the current application's main window.

## Syntax

```csharp
DispatcherHelper.ExecuteOnUIThreadAsync<T>(() =>
{
    // Code to execute on main window's UI thread
});

await CoreApplication.MainView.Dispatcher.AwaitableRunAsync<T>( () =>
{
    
});
```

```vb
DispatcherHelper.ExecuteOnUIThreadAsync(Of T)(Function()
    ' Code to execute on main window's UI thread
End Function)

Await CoreApplication.MainView.Dispatcher.AwaitableRunAsync(Of T)(Function()

End Function)
```

## Example

```csharp
// Executing from a non-UI thread with helper method
int returnedFromUIThread = await DispatcherHelper.ExecuteOnUIThreadAsync<int>(() =>
{
    // Code to execute on main window's UI thread
    NormalTextBlock.Text = "Updated from a random thread!";
    return 1;
});

// returnedFromUIThread now is 1, execution can go on from the non-UI thread

// Or update it manually via the Extension method for CoreDispatcher
returnedFromUIThread = await CoreApplication.MainView.Dispatcher.AwaitableRunAsync<int>(() =>
{
    NormalTextBlock.Text = "Updated from a random thread with extension method!";
    return 1;
});
```

```vb
' Executing from a non-UI thread with helper method
Dim returnedFromUIThread As Integer = Await DispatcherHelper.ExecuteOnUIThreadAsync(Of Integer)(Function()
    ' Code to execute on main window's UI thread
    NormalTextBlock.Text = "Updated from a random thread!"
    Return 1
End Function)

' returnedFromUIThread now is 1, execution can go on from the non-UI thread

' Or update it manually via the Extension method for CoreDispatcher
returnedFromUIThread = Await CoreApplication.MainView.Dispatcher.AwaitableRunAsync(Of Integer)(Function()
    NormalTextBlock.Text = "Updated from a random thread with extension method!"
    Return 1
End Function)
```
