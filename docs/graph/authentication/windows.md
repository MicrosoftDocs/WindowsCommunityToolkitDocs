# WindowsProvider

The WindowsProvider is an authentication provider for accessing locally configured accounts on Windows.
It extends [IProvider](./custom.md) and uses the native Windows AccountManager (WAM) APIs and AccountsSettingsPane for sign in.

Available in the `CommunityToolkit.Authentication.Uwp` package.

## Prerequisite Windows Store Association in Visual Studio

To get valid tokens and complete sign in, the app will need to be associated with the Microsoft Store. This will enable your app to authenticate consumer MSA accounts without any additional configuration.

1. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the UWP project, then select **Store -> Associate App with the Store...**

2. In the wizard, click **Next**, sign in with your Windows developer account, type a name for your app in **Reserve a new app name**, then click **Reserve**.

3. After completing the app registration, select the new app name, click **Next**, and then click **Associate**. This adds the required Windows Store registration information to the application manifest.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a Windows Developer account to use the WindowsProvider in your UWP app. You can [register a Microsoft developer account](https://developer.microsoft.com/store/register) if you don't already have one.

## Prerequisite Configure Client Id in Partner Center

If your product integrates with Azure AD and calls APIs that request either application permissions or delegated permissions that require administrator consent, you will also need to enter your Azure AD Client ID in Partner Center:

`https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/products/&lt;YOUR-APP-ID&gt;/administrator-consent`

This lets administrators who acquire the app for their organization grant consent for your product to act on behalf of all users in the tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to specify the client id if you need admin consent for delegated permissions from your AAD app registration, or need to support more advanced authentication scenarios like SSO. Simple authentication for consumer MSA accounts does not require a client id or any additional configuration in Azure for basic access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to Register Client Id in Azure first following the guidance here: [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
>
> After finishing the initial registration page, you will also need to add an additional redirect URI. Click on "Add a Redirect URI" and add the value retrieved from running `WindowsProvider.RedirectUri` at runtime.
>
> You'll also want to set the toggle to **true** for "Allow public client flows".
>
> Then click "Save".

## Syntax

The WindowsProvider can be used in just one line of code:

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Authentication;

// Easily create a new WindowsProvider instance and set the GlobalProvider.
// Don't forget to associate your app with the Microsoft Store before attempting sign in.
ProviderManager.Instance.GlobalProvider = new WindowsProvider(new string[] { "User.Read", "Tasks.ReadWrite" });
```

The WindowsProvider can also be configured to disable auto-login or show custom content in the `AccountsSettingsPane`.
Configuration for specifying supported account types (such as AAD) is available via the `WebAccountProviderConfig` object.

```CSharp
using CommunityToolkit.Authentication;

// Provider config
string[] scopes = { "User.Read", "People.Read", "Calendars.Read", "Mail.Read" };

// Additional parameters are also available,
// such as custom settings commands for the AccountsSettingsPane.
Guid settingsCommandId = Guid.NewGuid();
void OnSettingsCommandInvoked(IUICommand command)
{
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("AccountsSettingsPane command invoked: " + command.Id);
}

// Configure which types of accounts should be available to choose from. The default is MSA, but AAD is also supported.
var webAccountProviderConfig = new WebAccountProviderConfig(WebAccountProviderType.Msa);

// ClientId is only required for approving admin level consent in AAD tenants or for supporting advanced authentication scenarios like SSO.
//var webAccountProviderConfig = new WebAccountProviderConfig(WebAccountProviderType.Aad, "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE");

// Configure details to present in the AccountsSettingsPane, such as custom header text and links.
var accountsSettingsPaneConfig = new AccountsSettingsPaneConfig(
    headerText: "Custom header text",
    commands: new List<SettingsCommand>()
    {
        new SettingsCommand(settingsCommandId: settingsCommandId, label: "Click me!", handler: OnSettingsCommandInvoked)
    });

// Determine it the provider should automatically sign in or not. Default is true.
// Set to false to delay silent sign in until SignInAsync or TrySilentSignInAsync is called.
bool autoSignIn = false;

// Set the GlobalProvider with the extra configuration
ProviderManager.Instance.GlobalProvider = new WindowsProvider(scopes, accountsSettingsPaneConfig, webAccountProviderConfig, autoSignIn);
```
