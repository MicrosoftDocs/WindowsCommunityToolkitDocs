# Custom provider

If you have existing authentication code in your application, you can create a custom provider to enable authentication and access to Microsoft Graph for the toolkit's Graph based controls and helpers. To bring your own authentication provider logic, start by extending `IProvider`.

## IProvider

`IProvider` is the base interface for creating authentication providers that work with the various controls and helpers in the toolkit. Handle authenticaiton with one of our premade `IProvider` implementations or create your own.

> Available in the `CommunityToolkit.Authentication` package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Community Toolkit - Graph Controls and Helpers packages are in preview. To get started using WCT preview packages visit the [WCT Preview Packages wiki page](https://aka.ms/wct/wiki/previewpackages).

```csharp
using CommunityToolkit.Authentication;

// Create an instance of your custom IProvider implementation.
IProvider customProvider = new CustomProvider(); 

// Set the global provider using the custom instance.
ProviderManager.Instance.GlobalProvider = customProvider;
```
