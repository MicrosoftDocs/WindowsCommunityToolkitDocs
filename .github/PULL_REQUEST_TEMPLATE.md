<!-- When opening a PR, start by forking this repository. Then, based on the type of change you're making you'll need to create a new branch from either the `master` or `dev` branches:

If you have a typo or existing document improvement to an already shipped feature, please base your change off of the [master branch](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/tree/master). This will allow us to get the change to the published documentation between releases.

For documentation regarding any new features, please base your fork off the last updated dev branch. For example: 'dev/7.1.0'.

We will merge updates from the current main branch to the latest dev branch to keep it in-sync with any updated changes. We will periodically sync the main branch automatically with the live branch to pick up any changes made over time. When we make a new release, we will integrate the dev branch into the main branch in order to publish documentation for new features.
